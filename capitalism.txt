EVERY MORNING I WAKE UP AND OPEN PALM SLAM A CAPITALISM INTO THE SLOT. ITS ADAM SMITHS INVISIBLE HAND AND RIGHT THEN AND THERE I START DOING THE MOVES ALONGSIDE WITH THE MAIN CHARACTER, A CAPITALIST.

NOT MANY CAN SAY THEY ESCAPED THE GALAXYâ€™S MOST DANGEROUS SOCIALIST DEMOCRACY. I CAN. I SAY IT AND I SAY IT OUTLOUD EVERYDAY TO PEOPLE IN MY COLLEGE CLASS AND ALL THEY DO IS PROVE PEOPLE IN COLLEGE CLASS CAN STILL BE IMMATURE JERKS.
